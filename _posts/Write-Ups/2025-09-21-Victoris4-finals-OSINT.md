## <span style="color:#0056D2;">**Introduction**</span>

After a full 6 hours in the `IEEE VICTORIS4 CTF` finals phase, I’m happy to share my write-up for three OSINT challenges I created: two Investigations (*Easy/Medium*) and one Geo (*Hard*).

This is a step-by-step walkthrough aimed at beginners.

## <span style="color:#0056D2;">**Domains of Deception**</span>


### Description


>Whispers spread across the net: a phantom domain-smith forging shadows of giants.
His masterpiece? rnicrosoft[.]com — a false mirror of trust, luring the careless.
One careless step led hunters to his trail.
>
>Follow the traces. Unmask the trickster. Gather his secrets.
>
>### Flag parts:
>⦁	First part (scammer name): the scammer’s real first name.
>
>⦁	Second part (oldest domain): of the >16,390 domains registered under the scammer’s name, identify the oldest domain registration (domain string only, e.g. example[.]com).
>
>⦁	Third part (leaks): how many data leaks (leaked datasets) were found associated with the scammer’s accounts? (a numeric count)
>
>***Bounus: If you recover a password from the leaked data, submit it as an optional fourth Bounus token.***
>
>### Flag format:
>
> IEEE{Real_Name,oldest.domain,Leakcount}

First, we need the `Scammer's name` so we open [WHOIS Domain Lookup](https://www.whois.com/whois/rnicrosoft.com) and search with the domain name, now we know who is the Registrant a.k.a. `Scammer` and also some extra useful info about him.

![alt text](/assets/images/Write-Ups/victoris4_OSINT_finals/WHOIS.png)

Now, we know that he has over 16,390 domains registered under his name,
with that much records, if we went to [whoisology.com](https://whoisology.com/name/park%20hyungjin/1) and searched with the Registrant name `Park HyungJin`, we will get a partial list of records, but those records aren't in order and we will have to search the Creation Date manually in all of them.

After some search, we find this [website](https://www.bigdomaindata.com/reverse-whois/) that offers the full list wit a price of `$25`, it also shows only 100 records without price as a free trial, so we clarify our search filter like this:

![alt text](/assets/images/Write-Ups/victoris4_OSINT_finals/<Search-filter.png>)

Now we get this result for the oldest 100 records:

![alt text](/assets/images/Write-Ups/victoris4_OSINT_finals/result.png)

***NOTE: You can also find it [here](https://whoisfreaks.com/tools/user/whois/reverse/search/owner/park%20hyungjin?exact=true&page=4#open-modal-0) but there is no guarantee the this is the oldest one, the records aren't in order***

Last part, we need to find numeric count of leaks that his email appeared in , so we open [HIBP](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) and search with his email `b2c@naver.com`, the result is `4.

Flag: <span style="color:#0056D2;">**{Park_HyungJin,wni.net,4}**</span>

For the Bounus part, we go to [BreachDirectory](https://breachdirectory.org/) and search for the email `b2c@naver.com`, we get this result:

![alt text](/assets/images/Write-Ups/victoris4_OSINT_finals/breachdirectory.png)

Now we already have the first password `1111`. To get the other one we open any hash cracker and select the `sha1` algorithm and we get the second password:

![alt text](/assets/images/Write-Ups/victoris4_OSINT_finals/hash-cracker.png)

***NOTE: you can also use this [tg bot](@HaveIBeenHacked_Bot) made by [Kalawy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohamedwagdy72/) to get the passwords straightforward.***

## <span style="color:#0056D2;">**KA-SAT**</span>



>### Description
>In the dawn fog before battle, a pure evil rose, an evil that will touch the sky, the `KA-SAT` had been compromised, What began as legitimate commands became a destructive wiper.
>
>Investigate this breach using your OSINT and Threat-Intel skills.
>
>---
>
>### Flag Parts:
>
>1. Consumer brand of the affected service.
>2. The group responsible for the attack.
>3. CRC32-b hash of the only string this wiper writes.
>4. CRC32-b hash of all 8 targeted paths within the binary (comma separated, in the same order within the binary).
>
>**NOTE:** if the paths were: `/usr/bin/`, `/usr/sbin`, `/usr/tmp`, then the hash will be:
>
>
>>CRC32("/usr/bin/,/usr/sbin,/usr/tmp")
>

First, a simple search will bring us to the official [incident report ](https://www.viasat.com/perspectives/corporate/2022/ka-sat-network-cyber-attack-overview/) from `Viasat`, the owner of the satellite, Now we know what was the incident.

Within the report we find the Consumer brand of the affected service mentioned here:

![alt text](/assets/images/Write-Ups/victoris4_OSINT_finals/Tooway.png)

Now, we go to the [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/software/) software page and search for the incident, we can find it here with the name of the group `SandWorm` and also the wiper name `AcidRain`.

![alt text](/assets/images/Write-Ups/victoris4_OSINT_finals/mitre-attack.png)

After knowing the wiper name we can [Malware Bazaar](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/browse.php?search=tag%3AAcidRain) and search with the tag `AcidRain`, we see two samples, we download the oldest one matching the attack date and start analyzing.

![alt text](/assets/images/Write-Ups/victoris4_OSINT_finals/malware-bazaar.png)

Submitting the sample to [Joe Sandbox](https://www.joesandbox.com/analysis/601024/0/html#overview), we can find the only string printed by searching the `Standard Output` field.

![alt text](/assets/images/Write-Ups/victoris4_OSINT_finals/output.png)

Using [CyberChef](https://cyberchef.org/#recipe=CRC-32_Checksum()&input=TG9vayBvdXQh) with CRC-32, we get our third part of the flag `3f2d5b79`

![alt text](/assets/images/Write-Ups/victoris4_OSINT_finals/first-hash.png)

For the last part, according to [Sentinel Labs](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/acidrain-a-modem-wiper-rains-down-on-europe/) report, the targeted paths are hardcoded within the binary making it easy for an in-depth wipe of the filesystem and various known storage device files, so we only need to run `strings` on the binary to get them in order.

![alt text](/assets/images/Write-Ups/victoris4_OSINT_finals/strings.png)

Now we have them:
- /dev/loopXX
- /dev/sdXX
- /dev/mtdXX
- /dev/mtdblockXX
- /dev/block/mtdblockXX
- /dev/mmcblkXX
- /dev/block/mmcblkXX

***NOTE: in the description, I asked for 8 targeted paths, there are only 7; I mistakenly counted `/dev/null` as a targeted path.***

So now, we format them as the description said, and we get this hash `a05e040f`

First with some image-searching, the construction style strongly suggests this place is in `عين السبع بالمغرب`.

![alt text](/assets/images/Write-Ups/victoris4_OSINT_finals/Aïn-Sebaâ.JPG)

We notice that there is a banner hanged on the playground wall's net, It has some Arabic words but we cann't read it clearly, this is a strong identication that Morocco is correct

![alt text](/assets/images/Write-Ups/victoris4_OSINT_finals/1.png)

After some edit to the image and giving it to any AI agent, we can conclude that the phrase is `الفضاء الرياضي إقامة الشباب`, so we search on it on the maps and start search for any playgrounds in the found area till we find this:

![alt text](/assets/images/Write-Ups/victoris4_OSINT_finals/maps.png)

Opening the street view, we get these two images:
